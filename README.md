This repository contains source codes and files for our team application. <br>
This application aims to identify spices from its images. <br>
To identify the image, we use a Machine Learning model trained with a dataset and TensorFlow. <br>
Dataset used in this research available [here](https://github.com/ahmdxrzky/capstone-bangkit-2022/tree/main/dataset/spices.zip) <br>
There are 1506 training images and 300 testing images.
